# PlaceRecognitionDB
PlaceRecognitionDB is a tool for creating optimally sized databases (containing the minimum number of frames covering the scene) for place recognition task from RGBD and LiDAR data.

The goal of the project is to create a tool with an optimal compression strategy for any RGBD and LiDAR data.
