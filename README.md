PlaceRecognitionDB is a tool for creating optimally sized databases 
(containing the minimum number of frames covering the scene) for place recognition task from RGBD and LiDAR data.

The tool supports several basic methods for creating databases, 
as well as the DominatingSet method for creating optimal databases.

The tool also contains a global Localization pipeline with [CosPlace](https://github.com/gmberton/CosPlace) 
and [NetVLAD](https://github.com/QVPR/Patch-NetVLAD). 
The models of these neural networks can be fine-tuned for a particular previously created database. 
The results of global localization can also be improved with [SuperGlue](https://github.com/magicleap/SuperGluePretrainedNetwork).

We have also developed a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate 
the quality of created databases and the accuracy of VPR systems.
